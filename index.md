### Setting the Amount of the Annual Assessment (Q2 Board of Directors meeting)

For the April Board Meeting the annual assessment for the current year is determined. According to the SSHOA Restrictive Covenants, Article VI Covenants for Maintenance Assessments, Section 3 Maximum Annual Assessment, the yearly assessments are determined as follow:

“… the maximum annual assessment applicable to each Lot or Living Unit may be increased

each year not more than the “Maximum Percentage” (as defined below) above the maximum and annual assessment applicable to each such Lot or Living Unit for the previous year without a vote of the membership. The “Maximum Percentage” for any shall be the greater of (i) three percent (3%) or (ii )the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index, 1957-59 Base, All items, District of Columbia Area, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, or its successor, in the report most current on the first day of such year as compared to the report most current on the first day of the preceding year.”

Consumer Price Index for January to January is released by March. To find the January-to-January CPI as a percentage:

- go to [<ins>https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm</ins>](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/data.htm) ;
    
- In the "CPI Data" drop down click on "Regional Resources";
    
- the map provides the CPI for regional areas with DC part of the southern region. This is NOT the index stated in the BY-Laws. To the right of the map there is a listing with the header "Metro Areas (CBSA)". Click on "Washington";
    
- One gets a table of the actual CP index in dollars with the series title "All items in Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV, all urban consumers, not seasonally";
    
- Using the “More Formatting Options” one can ask for the 12 month percentage change. Click “Retrieve Data” and get the same table with actual dollar indices, and below that the matching table with percentages;
    
- Look in this percentage table under the January column for the Jan-to-Jan year-to-year change.
    

For example: the Jan. 2021-to-Jan. 2022 CPI index was 6.0%;

the Jan. 2022-to-Jan. 2023 CPI index was 4.4%;

the Jan. 2023-to-Jan. 2024 CPI index was 3.6%;
